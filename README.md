## ðŸš€ About Me

Hello everyone,

My name is Daniel Gonzalez,

Over the past few months, I have undertaken an intensive training program in front-end development with a focus on React at OpenClassrooms. 

This training has allowed me to specialize in front-end development, using a highly regarded framework in the industry.

Before that, I completed an initial training program in web development, where I gained a foundation in programming (HTML, CSS, JS) for both front-end and back-end development. I worked on aspects such as web integration, creating APIs and databases, accessibility, SEO, and more.

Here is my portfolio, feel free to visit it to see my latest projects `:smile:`
